ERP System:-
-------------
According to the basic definition ERP is the system manages the entire company. It is the one system for all. 
An Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system is a software solution that integrates various business processes and functions within an organization into a single unified system.
It enables efficient data sharing, collaboration, and automation across different departments and facilitates better decision-making. Here's an explanation of each of the listed
modules within an ERP system:

Below are the different modules present under ERP:-
----------------------------------------------------
Finance:
The finance module in an ERP system handles all financial aspects of the organization. It includes functionalities such as general ledger, accounts payable and receivable, financial
reporting, budgeting, taxation, asset management, cash flow management, and financial analysis. This module helps businesses track their financial transactions, manage their funds,
and generate accurate financial statements.

Sales and Distribution:
The sales and distribution module manages the entire sales process, from customer inquiries to order fulfillment. It includes functionalities like sales order processing, pricing, 
customer relationship management (CRM), order tracking, inventory management, shipping, and invoicing. This module streamlines the sales process, enhances customer satisfaction, and
ensures efficient order processing and delivery.

Human Resources:
The human resources (HR) module focuses on managing employee-related processes. It covers areas such as employee information, payroll, benefits administration, recruitment,
performance management, training, time and attendance tracking, and compliance with labor laws. The HR module helps organizations effectively manage their workforce and ensure 
employee satisfaction and compliance.

Production Planning:
The production planning module helps organizations manage their manufacturing processes. It involves functionalities like demand forecasting, production scheduling, capacity planning,
resource allocation, quality control, and tracking work-in-progress. This module optimizes production operations, minimizes bottlenecks, and ensures efficient utilization of 
resources.

Material Management:
The material management module, also known as inventory management, handles the procurement and storage of materials and goods. It includes features like inventory control, 
procurement, vendor management, material tracking, stock valuation, and reorder point calculation. This module ensures that the right materials are available when needed, minimizing
excess inventory and reducing carrying costs.

Controlling:
The controlling module, often referred to as cost accounting, focuses on managing and controlling costs within the organization. It encompasses functionalities such as cost 
allocation, cost center accounting, profit center accounting, budgeting, variance analysis, and performance measurement. This module provides insights into the financial performance
of different departments or projects, allowing management to make informed decisions to optimize costs and improve profitability.

These modules collectively make up an ERP system, enabling organizations to centralize their data, automate processes, improve collaboration, and gain a holistic view of their 
operations, which ultimately leads to increased efficiency and competitiveness.


Key Features and Benefits of ERP:-
---------------------------------
Features:
---------
Real- time:- You can have a complex view of all your business in real-time. (Any time you want)
Common Database: - Everyone works on same database which increases productivity and less prone in making errors
Manage Entire company :- You dont need independent software, you have all in one.
Enterprise Wide Integration:- Business process are integrated end to end across departments and business units
Eg:- For example a new order automatically intiates the credit check, queries product availbabilutu and updates their distribution schdeule. So once order is shipped the invoice is 
sent.
Consistent Look and feel:-
The user interface so what you on screen , is similar to each module.If someones changes the department and stops using one module, he will easily find himself in another.

Benefits:
---------
Higher productivity :- Your team work is more efficient beacause they have all the information they need in one system. (They improve inventory management, increase stock turn and 
deliver more fatser)
Less Complexity :- You have one system.
Better Insights :- Now you can report and analyze any way you want to make more informed decisions and gain business agility.
High security :- Need to worry on Data security of one system.

Evolution of SAP System:
----------------------------
1972: R/1 (Realtime 1 tier Architecture)
->Supports only Accounting
->Ran on MS DOS
-> Served 40 customers

1979: R/2 (Realtime 2 tier Architecture)
->Based on Mainframe
->Included most of Enterprise functions like Supply Chain, Manufacturing processes, Accounting and HR. (Lot of modules)
->Supports Multiple languages and currencies
-> Served 2200 customers

1992: R/3 (Realtime 3 tier Architecture) -> with defined separate data-base layer, application layer and presentation layer
-> SAP Presentation Layer is shown as  SAP GUI where SAP sever gets connected to this.
-> SAP R/3 was built on the client-server concept, having a uniform graphical interface dedicated to use of relational databases and supports servers from various manufacturers.
-> Supports all Business Functionalities
-> Served 15000 customers

2004: SAP ERP (ECC) -> Enterprise Central Component
SAP ERP ECC, also known simply as SAP ECC, was the core version of SAP's ERP software suite.
-> 3-layer Architecture
-> Lot of Modules
-> New Paltform (Net-Weaver)
-> Served 24000 customers

2015: SAP S/4 HANA
-> 3-layer Architecture
-> lot of modules
-> SAP HANA is a new SAP ERP platform that runs on the SAP HANA database. This database use in-memory database technology , which makes the system super fast.
-> S/4 HANA has the ability to log into the system directly from the web browser.
-> The name of this welcoming user interface is FIORI. 
-> So in this case we have user interface of standard SAP GUI and user interface of FIORI interface in web browser. The FIORI interface can still be used only for some
parts of the system and still most of the things on the system are done using the SAP GUI.

SAP ECC went through several enhancement packs and versions over the years, but its core architecture and functionalities remained largely consistent. However, as technology and 
business needs evolved, SAP introduced its successor, SAP S/4HANA (SAP Business Suite 4 SAP HANA), which is built on the SAP HANA in-memory database platform. SAP S/4HANA offers 
advanced features, improved performance, and a more streamlined architecture compared to SAP ECC

Note:-
-----
SAP has been encouraging its customers to transition from SAP ECC to SAP S/4HANA, as SAP ECC's mainstream maintenance was planned to end in 2027.

Architecture of SAP:
----------------------
-> Client server model is used for SAP system.So basically you have a special program on local computer to connect to a SAP system, which is called SAP GUI. Means here you will get
connected to SAP sever by providing the login credentials.
-> So in the latest version of S/4 HANA  there has the flexibility to log into the system directly from the web browser.The name of this welcoming User Interface is called FIORI browser.

-> SAP  R/2- 2tier (2 layer) Architecture the application and Database layer are present at SAP server side and  Presentation layer is the client (Front end) i.e; SAP GUI.
-> SAP  R/3- 2tier (3 layer) Architecture the application and Database layer are seperated. Presentation layer -> Application layer -> Database layer (This way it is connected).Here
the presentation layer is the client (Front end) i.e; SAP GUI and Web page FIORI

SAP Menu , Transactions:
------------------------
-> Basically the SAP menu screen consists of differet options. Here we will tree like structure where it consists different modules as individual folders and it subfolders and finally
a business task. A business task is an application or program that we execute from SAP menu. They have a characteristic cube symbol.
-> In a SAP langauge a business task or program is called a transaction. Each transaction has its own character identifier. We have transaction code or T-code before than that name. 
Eg: MM03 - Display current

SAP Modules:
----------------
-> Basically the main modules of SAP are below three. Under this there are some sub folders and sub modules.
1. Logistics
MM - Material Management
SD - Sales and Distribution

2. Accounting
FI - Financial Accounting
CO - Controlling

3. Human Resources

Favourites:
----------
-> Favourites are basically created to make the work easier. You can create folders, subfolders and add transactions under them (Basically which are used on daily purpose). 
This all will be done under the Favourites section.


Master and Transaction Data:-
---------------------------
->It can be said that data in SAP are usually objects such as material,customer, vendor and we also have documents such as quotataion, sales order and inovoice.
-> This objects are divided into 2 categories like Master and Transaction Data.

Master Data: 
------------
-> Represents the things, people and  places the organization deals with
eg:- Customer, Vendor, Material and Employee
-> Can consider master data as nouns 
-> Master data is created and changed less  frequently.
Transaction Data: 
-----------------
-> On the other hand transaction data represents and event which the master data participates. Here event means something action happened on the system.Each event is SAP is registerd
usually in the form of a document.
eg:- Quotation, Sales order, Invoice, Goods issue and Goods receip etc)
A Company has sold an item ( We have sales order document for this)
A Customer has paid (Invoice or Billing document)
An item has released from stock  (We have one of material movement document like Goods Issue or a Goods Receipt)
Item has been Shipped ( We have shipment document)
-> Transaction data as Verbs
-> Transaction data are related to day-to-day activities.So they change several times.

Organizational Structure:
-------------------------
-> An Enterprise structure is the structure that represents an enterprise in the SAP system.
-> In SAP combination of sales, organization, distribution channel and division is  called  as Sales area.
-> For customizing and creating we go to /nSPRO in our SAP menu. Under this we go SAP Reference -> Enterprise structure. Under this we have 2 main things to concentrate ie; Definition
and Assignment.
-> SO SAP Customizing we use SPRO. Bascially customization is done by Experts mostly the functional consultants for the respective modules.So this is not that simple they need to do 
it carefully since it is complex.
SAP Configuration:
------------------
-> So basically the configuration part is required when there is requirement for new categories that need to be created. This configuration or adding up all the new things will be
taken care by experts.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Module 3:-
----------
Transactions connected to Material:
-----------------------------------
-> MM01 - Create Material 
-> MM02 - Change Material
-> MM03 - Display Material -> For this basically the system prompts the lately used material. Amd in display mode we cant change/modify anything

-> If you are creating a material make sure that name i already.


Note:-
-----
/nMM01 -> The transaction for creation of material opens in same window
/oMM01 -> The transaction for creation of material opens in different window

Transactions connected to Customer:
-----------------------------------
-> XD01 - Customer Create
-> XD02 - Customer Change

-> VA01 - Sales Order Create
-> VA02 - Sales Order Change
-> VA03 - Sales Order Display

Note:-
-----
-> Basically material object or material master data, material document is very big object in SAP with lots of fields. So its not possible to show all that information into views.
-> We use to find a helpful description of the field you are in at the moment in SAP UI using F1 Key.

Material Price:
---------------
-> Price to documents is taken in SAP from so called condition records. This module or this part of configuration of the system is called material pricing.

Transactions connected to Material Pricing:
-------------------------------------------
Select using condition type
-> VK11 - Create
-> VK12 - Change
-> VK13 - Display
-> VK12 - Create with Template

Material Movements:   Warehouse/ Stock/ Storage Location
---------------------------------------------------------
-> Goods receipt (When goods are coming to warehouse) and Goods issue (When goods are going out of warehouse) are material movements and for that we create document in SAP.  
-> We go to  transaction MMBE (Stock Overview) and check what is the stock quantity of that material in our storage.
-> MIGO( Goods movements) and here it will be goods receipt.

Customer Creation:
-----------------
Transactions connected to Customer:
-----------------------------------
-> XD01 - Customer Create
-> XD02 - Customer Change
-> XD03 - Customer Display -> system helps and pre-fills the last created customer

-> In creation of material so decide what should be the name of material and we maintain that as a unique one but where in case of creation of customer system will assign the next
sequential number of the customer.


Order-to-cash (O2C) process:
---------------------------
-> It is one of the most generic sales business processes and it is used by most of the companies.
-> Officially Order-to-cash is an integration point between Finance(FI) and Sales and Distribution(SD).

Material Movements:
-------------------
Goods receipt -> When goods are coming to warehouse
Goods issue   -> When goods are going out of warehouse
 
Pre Sale Activities:
---------------------
-> Inquiry :- It is something like the question to the company, if they are able to provide us the some goods and what is the price. Based on this Quotation will be done.
-> Quotation :- It is much more like a detailed document and there we have information when the goods will be shipped,how the goods will be shipped and all detail condition of that
one shipping of goods. Based on Quotation sales order is created.

Process:-
----------
Inquiry -> Quotation -> Sales Order -> Delivery -> Billing Document    (So at the delivery stage Goods issue will takes place)
----PreSales--------Order Processing----Shipping------ Billing/Invoice-------
 -> This aboev process is also called as Sales and Distribution process
 
Inquiry:-
--------
Transactions connected to Inquiry:
----------------------------------
-> VA11 - Inquiry Create
-> VA12 - Inquiry Change
-> VA13 - Inquiry Display

Sold to party :- Sold to party is who will pay for the goods we order
Ship to party :- Where the goods will be sent to
-> We can use In completion log if we want to check whether all the details in document are completely entered or not

Quotation:-
----------
Transactions connected to Quotation:
----------------------------------
-> VA21 - Quotation Create
-> VA22 - Quotation Change
-> VA23 - Quotation Display

-> Here the Quotation document is created based on reference i.e from the Inquiry
-> Basically the customer sent the Inquiry doesnt see the price. And the first time when he sees this price is at the time of Quotation.

Sales order:
-----------
Transactions connected to Sales:
--------------------------------
-> VA01 - Sales Order Create
-> VA02 - Sales Order Change
-> VA03 - Sales Order Display

-> So the Quotation is sent to customer either through email or other. Based on this Quotation sales order is placed.

Outbound Delivery:
------------------
-> Picked Quantity :- This means someone took goods from the warehouse.It has moved from the warehouse location.

Goods issue:
---------------
-> So we use the Outbound delivery number and use that for Goods issue. Finally we check whether the stock has been issued and count of stock has been decreased or not using 
/nMMBE command (Stock Overview)

Billing / Invoice:
------------------
-> This is the final part of O2C process.
Transactions connected to Billing:
----------------------------------
-> VF01 - Billing Create
-> VF02 - Billing Change
-> VF03 - Billing Display

-> The important thing here is we create billing document with reference to delivery document number.
